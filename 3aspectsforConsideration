There's basically a few key things to figure out if you want to transition to mostly cryptocurrencies, or crypto, for your daily life.  The first issue is getting money into the crypto economy.  The second issue is portfolio management, where you decide how the crypto money is managed, to minimize risk, while accumulating crypto.  The third issue is spending crypto in a fiat world.  Much of the world is still fiat based, so going back to the legacy systems is something that most will have to deal with for the time being.

Section 1 Getting money into the crypto economy.
The general  goal is to  convert your earnings to crypto for the least fees as possible.

Ideally, you could have your employer pay you in crypto, but in most cases you will need to convert government money, fiat; the particular money that the government requests for taxes.  Some exchanges will not charge fees for moving fiat to stablecoin versions of the fiat to the exchange, which is convenient and cheap onboarding.  Coinbase does this for USDC coin, from a bank account.

For people that have direct deposit, there's some services that will convert a direct deposit to your specified cryptocurrency.  You will set up your direct deposit account with your employer just like a normal bank account.  Services such as Bitwage, will accept a direct deposit, just like a normal bank account, and then convert the direct deposit to crypto.  Sometimes it's easier to just setup a crypto purchase reminder on your phone calendar.

Another way is to use a credit or debit card to buy crypto.  Generally it's more expensive to enter the crypto economy this way, but some cards have the cash back rewards.  Also, when buying with a card the crypto is usually available to trade immediately, which can be advantageous during volatile times.  Sometimes with bank accounts, the crypto won't be available for a few days or weeks.  If buying with a card, buy during dips in the price or if the price of your desired crypto is spiking, just buy the stablecoin and set a price alert to tell you when the price of the desired crypto is at a more reasonable buying price.

Section 2 â€“ Portfolio management.

When investing in crypto you need to make some decisions on which cryptocurrencies to invest in or hodl.  I recommend specifying your portfolio in percentages, that way you don't have too much risk in on or two assets.  For example if you're investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero, you will want to analyze how much volatility you are comfortable with in your portfolio, and then decide on your percentages.  Sometimes adjusting your portfolio percentages based on how confident you are in the price maintaining its current level is useful.  

After one particular part of my portfolio has a price spike, I will distribute half of the recent gains to the rest of my portfolio to minimize any losses if the price spike reverses.  A quick price history analysis can reveal how much a price retraces after price spikes, using previous price spikes is a good general guide.  Also, another good rule of thumb is to take 10% profit after every doubling.  For example if you bought $1000 worth of Ethereum at $200/ETH, then when Ethereum hits $400, which makes your initial purchase of $1000 worth $2000, you just sell $200 (10%) worth of ETH, to stablecoin or any other of your portfolio assets that seems to be a good value at the time.

Section 3

Spending crypto in a fiat world is pretty important if you want to live on crypto because a lot of services only accept fiat, but as crypto becomes more mainstream this step will become less and less important.  

For bills such as phone bills that are the same price monthly, it can be advantageous to buy these gift cards during crypto price spikes, to maximize your purchasing power.

One of the most useful ways to spend crypto  is by using the crypto debit card apps.  Instead of buying a bunch of different gift cards with crypto, the crypto debit card app is basically a gift card for every store that accepts debit cards.  Sometimes these apps require you to sell your crypto before spending via the debit card, but some conveniently allow you to sell the instant that you use your debit card. 

Conclusion

By taking more control of your financial future through using cryptocurrencies, you can profit and have more freedom to use your money without the constant criminal accusations from bankers.
