An observation from the recent elections is that there is usually around 50% of the population that disapproves of the government, yet most people still use government money, or fiat for the layman.  By using the government fiat that's created out of thin air, you're giving power to the government.  By saving in money that is only backed by the confidence in government,  you're putting your finances at unnecessary risk.  With government fiat, the government can decide when they want to dilute the purchasing power for everyone that is using their monetary system.  

Thanks to cryptocurrency there's an exit strategy from the government money problem.  By saving in cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BTC, or XMR; you're giving the government less control over the real value of your savings, because the monetary policy is programmed and more predictable.

In addition to the very inflationary monetary policy of government money, its banking systems' fractional reserve aspect instantly dilutes any deposits that you put into a bank.  Nowadays many of the reserve requirements are actually zero, so the purchasing power of peoples' government money savings is getting diluted quicker than ever.  In effect the increase in money supply of government money has no limits.

If you want to start converting your politically-charged government money to something more logical, then start cost averaging into a few cryptocurrencies every week or so.  By cost averaging every week you will limit your losses. Also, from my experience, your yearly profit from cost averaging will be far superior to any bank account.  

When you first start your crypto savings you will just accumulate and not really use your money for your daily finances, but after you start profiting from a few price spikes, the crypto part of your savings may become a larger part of your daily finances.  
  
In the crypto landscape, there are centralized services and decentralized services.  Generally centralized services, or crypto banks, can be easier to use, quicker, and have a better user experience due to the off-chain nature of the services.  If you wonder if a service is centralized or decentralized, you can usually tell by the requirement to verify your identity.  One of the problems with centralized services is that they can be shutdown at anytime due to a variety of reasons.  Also centralized services expose you to systematic theft, if you get sued or in trouble with the law, your assets could be easily confiscated.  For people that are new to crypto, centralized services can be a good way to start out, due to risk management being outsourced to the centralized service.

Decentralized services are rapidly evolving, and can provide services to anyone with an internet connection, which is nice for people that don't have access to banking services due to nationality, criminal history, or a plethora of other reasons. Decentralized services don't usually require identity verification, and offer the advantage of not being connected to an official identity.  The uptime for blockchain services is generally superior to non-blockchain services, but there is smart contract hack risk.  Risk can be minimized by minimizing exposure to smart contract risk by using insurance or keeping assets that aren't immediately needed in cold storage.  Decentralized services require a higher level of responsibility of the user because they are responsible for the safe keeping of the funds.  

In the beginning of your journey of abandoning the government money, you will want to start with a lower value of cryptocurrency to minimize damages, if you make a mistake.  Cryptocurrency can be complicated, so little mistakes can happen relatively easily in the beginning. I think everyone that's used cryptocurrencies has made a mistake or two.  One way to avoid mistakes is to always triple check every transaction before sending it.  Also, avoid making large transactions when you're tired.
