This is a quick run through on how I manage my Ethereum paycheck. 

I thought that a little tutorial for people that are already involved in cryptocurrencies, could be useful especially as defi evolves.  (It's kind of general, but I think generalities are good for rapidly evolving technology.)  Instead of just putting extra money here and there into cryptocurrencies, you can leverage crypto to capture gains all the while diversifying your portfolio at the end of each pay period.
