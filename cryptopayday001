A lot of people are shocked when I tell them that I get most of my paycheck in ETH.  At first glance, it seems risky to get paid in such a volatile asset.  Despite the price volatility of ETH, and in general most cryptocurrencies, by cost-averaging each paycheck into ETH it is suprisingly stable and actually quite profitable over the long term.
If you get paid in ETH or tokens that are on the Ethereum platform, you have easy access to a wonderful ecosystem of decentralized finance, or defi for short. The key to making your ETH paycheck more stable is to leverage it out, using one of the various defi websites, such as compound.finance.  By leveraging out your Ethereum, to get stable coins, you minimize your maximum loss, and retain profits during price spikes.
First off you need to figure out how much money you will need until the next payday.  If you are getting $1000 worth of ETH, but you need $800 for your bills you will not be able to leverage it all out, you will need to cash out, or convert $600 worth of your ETH to stablecoins before proceeding. Then when you leverage out the remaining $400 worth of ETH you will get approximately $200 worth of stablecoins from the loan.  In this way the $800 of value ($600 + $200) that you require for your bills is obtained, and you have $400 worth of ETH price exposure.
In order to leverage out your ETH, you just supply ETH as collateral in a decentralized application such as app.compound.finance, and get a loan for about 50% of the value of the ETH, in a stablecoin.  In this way, if ETH goes down, you might lose some of your ETH, but your maximum risk is about 50% of the value.  On the other hand if ETH price spikes you can withdraw some of the ETH out of the collateral to use as extra spending money, or to divert into a long term cold storage.
Over the time period between paydays, the price of ETH could fluctuate quite a bit.   At the end of each pay period, you just withdraw all of the excess value from the platform before starting a new leveraged position, to prepare for a new pay period.
For example, if you get paid every 2 weeks, you just pay off the stablecoin loan (DAI), and withdraw the remaining ETH from the platform.  One thing that is helpful is to always have enough extra stablecoins (such as DAI) already on the address to pay off the loan, that way you don't have to make multiple transactions while unwinding the leveraged position.  
The ETH that you withdrew, at the end of the pay period, can be used to diversify your crypto portfolio.  For example you could convert 40% of your withdrawn ETH to WBTC to gain exposure to BTC price, 40 % to a yield farming tokenset, and the remaining 20% of your ETH to a cold storage address.  By using this method you will integrate crypto savings into your normal finances, and build a diversified portfolio.
Here's a step by step breakdown.
1. Decide on how much ETH you want to supply to the decentralized finance protocol, from your ETH pay.  If you need more than 50% of your pay for bills and such, you will need to convert part of your ETH to stablecoins to lock in bill money before leveraging.
2. Supply ETH to the decentrailized finance protocol, such as app.compound.finance.
3. Borrow stablecoins, such as DAI, to use this for bill money.  The stablecoin value can be accessed when bills are due for payment with various crypto gift card and crypto debit card platforms.
5. At the end of the pay period, before leveraging your new paycheck, unwind your current leveraged position by paying off the loan with your extra stablecoins, and withdrawing the collateral.
6. Distribute the remaining ETH collateral to various assets such as tokensets, WBTC, or simply withdraw ETH to cold storage for safety.
7. Enjoy.
